# Plan

- What is the vision?
    - Provide a plug-&-play solution for common online path planning problems in robotics
    - Focus on sampling-based (RRT) solutions
    - Start with RRT, branch out to derivatives (RRT*, CL-RRT, etc.)
    - Want simple, common interface to all derivatives which can be swapped out easily
    - Emphasis on ease of use with absolute minimum configuration from the user
